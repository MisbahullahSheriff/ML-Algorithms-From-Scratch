# Gradient Boosting from Scratch

## Overview:
- This folder contains the code for implementing the Gradient Boosting algorithm from Scratch
 
## Files:
- `gb_regressor.ipynb`: contains implementation of gradient boosting regressor

## Remarks:
- Gradient Boosting is a widely used ensemble technique
  - Its the go-to algorithm for competitive data science competitions
- Gradient Boosting makes use of the concept of `Gradient Descent`
- Fits a base estimator on the residuals of the previous model in each training iteration
- It can be used for optimizing any differentiable loss function
- It can be used for solving classification as well as regression problems
