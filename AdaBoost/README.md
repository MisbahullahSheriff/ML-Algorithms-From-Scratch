# AdaBoost from Scratch

## Overview:
- This folder contains the code for implementing the AdaBoost Classification algorithm for Binary Classification
 
## Files:
- `adaboost.ipynb`: contains implementation of adaboost classifier

## Remarks:
- AdaBoost is a popular ensemble technique
  - It's a boosting technique that trains the base estimators in a sequential manner
- AdaBoost optimizes the exponential loss function during training phase
- It involves updating the weights of the training observations adaptively in each training iteration
- It can be used for solving classification as well as regression problems
